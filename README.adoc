= Webservice: LLM-based natural-language representations for SPARQL queries (API)

This project provides a web service for generating natural-language representations for SPARQL queries over the Wikidata or DBpedia knowledge graphs.

The corresponding web-based frontend -- LoRiS - â€‰LLM-generated natural-language representations of SPARQL queries over Wikidata and DBpedia -- is provided https://github.com/WSE-research/LoRiS-LLM-generated-Representations-of-SPARQL-queries[here].

== Online Demo (API)

The API is available at https://wse-research.org/api/sparql2nl

Sample request

```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://wse-research.org/api/sparql2nl?query_text=QUERYTEXT&language=LANG&shots=SHOTS&model=MODELID' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

* `query_text`: a SPARQL query over Wikidata or DBpedia
* `language`: English (en), German (de), or Russian (ru)
* `shots`: zero-shot (0), one-shot (1)
